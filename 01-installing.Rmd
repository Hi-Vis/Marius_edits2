# Getting started with R {#installing}


## Installing R

R, on its own, is basically just a command-line: you send it commands
and it sends back output. It comes with a "GUI" (graphical user
interface), but it's pretty ugly and I wouldn't recommend it.

To install R, go to the [CRAN website](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and
click the download link for either Windows or Mac OS X.

### Windows instructions

* Click [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/)
* Click `"base"`, and download.
* Run the installer and install - you shouldn't need to change any
  of the options.
  
### Mac OS X instructions

* Click [Download R for (Mac) OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
* Download the `.pkg` file for the latest release
* Open the installer and go through it:
  - "Install for all users" (the default) should be fine (if you have
    install rights on your machine)

## Installing RStudio

It's best to work with R through RStudio: it's a nice
interface that makes it easy to save and run scripts,
and see all the output and plots presented in the same window.

Head to the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 
to download the free version of **RStudio Desktop**: the free version is 100% 
fine and isn't missing any important features.

### Mac OS X notes

RStudio offers to install some "command line tools" the first time you
open it - go ahead and install them. You won't need them right now
but they do contain some useful tools like `git`.

## Running RStudio

Open up RStudio and you should see the standard 4-pane layout:

This may look like information overload at first, but most of the time, you'll
just be looking at the **"Scripts"** section where you've written your code.

```{block, type='note'}
**Optional:** Go to **Tools -> Global options -> Appearance** and switch 
to a dark theme - it's easier on the eyes and it looks cool.
```

You should now be able to run your first R command
by clicking in the console and typing `1 + 1` and hitting
\<Enter\>:

```{r first_command}
1 + 1
```


## Installing your first packages

A lot of the most useful tools in R come from third-party packages. Thankfully
they're easy to install, through the `install.packages()` command. Try
installing the `ggplot2` package (an excellent plotting package) to make 
sure everything is working:

```{r install_ggplot2, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2") #install
load.packages(ggplot2) #loading
```

The install process should be automatic, and it will also install
other packages that `ggplot2` needs. Just in case, you should check
the last few lines of the output that `install.packages()` produces,
and look for messages like:

```
package ‘ggplot2’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
```
